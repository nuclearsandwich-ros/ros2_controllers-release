ros-humble-diff-drive-controller (0.2.0-2bullseye) bullseye; urgency=high

  * Fix diff drive twist concurrency issues (#146 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/issues/146>)
    * Fix diff drive twist concurrency issues
    Before this fix, a twist message could be received and stored one
    thread, in the middle of the update() of the controller.
    This would be fixed by making a copy of the shared pointer at the
    beginning of the update() function, added realtime box to ensure safe
    concurrent access to the pointer.
    * Don't store limited command as last command
    Before these changes, the limited command overwrote the original
    command, which mean that it too much more time to reach the commanded
    speed.
    We only want this behavior when the command is too old and we replace it
    with 0 speed.
  * Diff drive parameter fixes (#145 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/issues/145>)
    * Recover old speed limiter behavior, if unspecified min defaults to -max
    * Change cmd_vel_timeout to seconds (double) as ROS1 instead of ms(int)
  * Unstamped cmd_vel subscriber rebased (#143 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_controllers/issues/143>)
